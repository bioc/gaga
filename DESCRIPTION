Title: GaGa hierarchical model for microarray data analysis
Author: David Rossell <rosselldavid@gmail.com>.
Maintainer: David Rossell <rosselldavid@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.5.0), Biobase, coda
Description: This package fits Rossell's generalizations of the Gamma-Gamma hierarchical model for microarray data analysis, which substantially improve the quality of the fit at a low computational cost. The model can be fit via empirical Bayes (Expectation-Maximization and Simulated Annealing) and fully Bayesian techniques (Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings posterior sampling). Routines are provided to perform differential expression analysis and class prediction.
