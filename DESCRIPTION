Title: GaGa hierarchical model for high-throughput data analysis
Author: David Rossell <rosselldavid@gmail.com>.
Maintainer: David Rossell <rosselldavid@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0), Biobase, coda
Description: This package fits Rossell's generalizations of the Gamma-Gamma hierarchical model for high-throughput data analysis, which substantially improve the quality of the fit at a low computational cost. The model can be used for differential expression analysis, supervised gene clustering, classification and sequential sample size calculation for high-throughput experiments.
